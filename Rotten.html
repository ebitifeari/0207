    <h1><span>Detective goes missing after buying oil from local manufacturers. </span></h1>
    <div class="quote">
        <p><b>Stephanie Soo</b>: It was the kind of case that could make or break a career. One detective had been tirelessly working on uncovering an international oil smuggling ring—one that stretched across borders and into the highest echelons of power. His investigation had taken him to dark corners of the world, and he was closer than ever to bringing the criminals to justice. But then, everything changed.</p>
        <p>One morning, he didn’t show up for work. His colleagues, accustomed to his early hours and meticulous routines, knew something was wrong. A search was launched, but no one could find him. His apartment was untouched, his car still parked in the garage. The only clue left behind was a single piece of paper with multiple oil stains, found at his last known location—a nondescript diner on the edge of town.</p>
        <p>The officers who found it were puzzled. The note was filled with strange numbers:</p>
        <pre><b>710 57735 34 5508 51 7718</b></pre>
        <p><b>MMB</b>: What? So was this note like some sort of GPS location coordinates?</p>
        <p><b>Stephanie Soo</b>: At first glance, it appeared to be some sort of cryptic code. But as investigators scoured the scene, one of the detectives noticed something strange about the numbers. They didn’t seem random at all. They actually learned the name of the oil selling ring boss just from this note.</p>
        <p><b>MMB</b>: They learned this person's name just from the note? What was it?
